# Abstract

**Background**

Millions of women are now using smartphone apps to track their menstrual cycles and associated symptoms, such as mastalgia (breast tenderness and pain). Breast tenderness is described as painful or uncomfortable sensations in the breast, sometimes with a change of volume or consistency of the breasts themselves.  The prevalence, intensity, timing and duration of mastalgia have not been optimally characterized. For many women there is a cyclic association with the menstrual cycle indicating a hormonal association, although the specific causes of pain are not well established. 

**Objectives**

To describe the prevalence, timing and duration of breast pain symptoms as reported by users of a menstrual cycle tracking app, and to evaluate changes in reported symptoms at birth control transitions.

**Methods**

We analyzed a retrospective dataset of 216,484 ¬users of the Clue app with over 4.5 million self-reports of “tender breasts”. Tracking behavior of users was characterized on a per-cycle basis and clustered into typical app usages. Symptoms reported by regular app users were further characterized with four distinct metrics, i.e. symptom timing, duration, cyclicity and variability from one cycle to the next. Birth control method was determined based on the users self-declared report, on their menstrual characteristics and on their pill-intake logs if any.

**Results**

Contraceptive pill users report, on average, fewer breast pain symptoms than non-pill users [3-6 times lower prevalence depending on age].  The oral contraceptive pill decreased reported breast pain for 48% of users who switched to oral contraceptives but increased this symptom for 32% of users (with the remaining 20% experiencing no change). Most users (62%) reported cyclic breast symptoms; 21% reported non-cyclic ones; symptoms of the remaining users could not be classified as cyclic or non-cyclic. There is overall a large inter-individual diversity in the reported patterns, as indicated by the distribution of our four metrics. Even within cyclic mastalgia, the temporal patterns (i.e. onset, offset and duration) of reported symptoms show less variability (sd is 80% smaller, 95CI: 79.7-80.7) within than between users.    

**Conclusion(s)**

This study confirms associations between steroid hormonal use and breast pain symptoms. It also shows that most affected users experience specific and consistent symptom patterns, which may reflect their underlying hormonal profiles or tissue-specific response. These woman-specific patterns have yet to be correlated with temporal bio-markers profiles or breast exam results to further advance our understanding of the mastalgia causes.
